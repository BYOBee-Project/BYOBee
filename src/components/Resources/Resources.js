      <p>
        There is an incredible diversity of bee species, with ~20,000 in the world, ~4,000 in North
        America and ~500 in Oregon alone! They come in all shapes and sizes, make their homes in a
        variety of unique places and together play an integral role in the pollination of our lands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, due to factors such as climate change, habitat loss, rampant pesticide usage,
        human management practices, and the spread of pests and disease - our bee populations are in
        decline. Here are a few simple ways to support pollinator populations of all kinds. üêùüíõ‚ú®

        <li>
          Plant native flowers that bloom at different stages of the season (and make sure they
          haven not been treated with pesticides).
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide habitat for tunnel-nesting bees, and leave brambles and bare, sunny patches in
          your yard for ground-nesters
        </li>
        <li>
          Purchase local and organic produce to increase the demand for bee-friendly farming
          practices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go pesticide-free! Pest-control products do not discriminate, and will kill bees alongside
          the target pest.
        </li>
        <li>
          Get involved in local citizen science efforts to help entomologist track important data on
          bee populations! Check out the{' '}
